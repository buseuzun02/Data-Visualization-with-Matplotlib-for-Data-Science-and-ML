# Applied NumPy for Data Science and ML

This project demonstrates the practical use of **NumPy**, a core Python library for numerical computing, in data science and machine learning workflows. It provides hands-on examples for efficient data manipulation and analysis.

## Key Features
- **Array Creation:** Using lists, `arange`, `linspace`, and random number generators.  
- **Array Operations:** Element-wise arithmetic, broadcasting, and mathematical functions.  
- **Indexing & Slicing:** Efficiently accessing and modifying array elements.  
- **Reshaping & Concatenation:** Changing array dimensions, stacking, and splitting arrays.  
- **Statistical & Linear Algebra Functions:** Computing mean, sum, standard deviation, dot products, and matrix operations.  
- **Practical Examples:** Real-world use cases for data preprocessing, numerical analysis, and machine learning pipelines.

## Purpose
Designed for both beginners and practitioners, this project illustrates how to leverage **NumPy for efficient numerical computations**, providing a strong foundation for data science, ML, and scientific computing in Python.
